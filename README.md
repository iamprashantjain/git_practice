- practicing git commands
- git is a version control system & github is a repository to store/manage codes
- "git init" --> to initialize any folder in local system as a repo on github, this will create a hidden folder ".git"
- initially files will say "U" which means untracked.. to track those files, use git add
- then use "git add README.md" to add readme file
- After adding the file, status will change to "A" means added
- check status using "git status"
- now commit all tracked files to temp staging environment which will be pushed to github repo later using "git commit -m 'adding readme file'"
- rename branch to main --> "git branch -M main" & check branch "git branch"
- add the location of repo where you want to push the staged files to using "git remote add origin https://github.com/iamprashantjain/git_practice.git"
- push staged files in main branch to repo using "git push -u origin main"
- After updating readme file.. send updated file to repo by first adding the file in staged environment, update commit msg & then push to repo.
