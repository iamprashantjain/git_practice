- practicing git commands
- git is a version control system & github is a repository to store/manage codes
- "git init" --> to initialize any folder in local system as a repo on github, this will create a hidden folder ".git"
- initially files will say "U" which means untracked.. to track those files, use git add
- then use "git add README.md" to add readme file
- check status using "git status"
